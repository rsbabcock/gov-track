    <!-- In your HTML, create an article tag that will serve as your main representative component. Give the element a unique identifier.
In this component, create a sub-component for basic information using the section tag. In this section create elements for the representative's image, name, district info, and political affiliation.
Beneath the basic information, you will create a sub-component, using a section tag, to list any committees the candidate is serving on.
The last component will hold links to any legislation that your representative has enacted. -->
